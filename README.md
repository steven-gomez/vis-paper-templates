This repository is meant to be an up-to-date index of venues for disseminating research in visualization and human factors. It contains submission deadlines, links to templates hosted elsewhere, and (as needed) local copies of templates that meet the specifications of each particular venue.

Feel free to contribute new venues or help maintain accurate information in this repository via pull requests.
